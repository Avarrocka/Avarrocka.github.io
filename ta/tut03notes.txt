- Explained python memory model

- Explained concept of garbage collection -- any 'boxes' without anything pointing to them are deleted

- Showed how to trace memory model through variable changes

- Showed how to trace memory model through different functions

- Explained the difference between Print and Return (Print puts output to console, whereas Return returns a value from a function and terminates it, giving it back to what called it)
e.g. 
def addOne(x):
    y = x + 1
    return y

x = addOne(5)
//if addOne() terminates and returns 6, then x = 6. 

- Explained that functions without Return statements will return a NoneType object. Remember to represent this using the Memory Model!
e.g.
def addOne(x):
    x = x + 1

x = addOne(5)
// x will equal NoneType

- Gave the resouce Python Tutor (google it). It's a great resource to see how to step-by-step trace a program using Dr. Harrington's model.
