								Figma, Hack the North, and more?
							</span>
							<br>
							<span style="font-size:12px;">
								Jun 6 2016
							</span> <br><br>
								My friends recently started talking about a new product currently in Beta called <a href="https://www.figma.com/">Figma</a>. I think this
								looks promising! As someone who thinks design is really cool (although I'm not very good at it, haha), this could be a really useful product. 
								What I see is something like Google Doc's collaborative nature coupled with the version control of Git. If the Beta can live up to everything 
								it promises, I could see this being the next big tool in any good designer's toolkit.
								<br><br>
								In other news, Hack the North finally opened their registration! After volunteering for them in 2013, I always thought that HTN was one of the premier 
								hackathons in Canada. A couple of my friends and I have applied, and if I hear back from them, that'll be awesome. When I was volunteering 
								back in 2013, they had this app called RememberAll or something. Basically, it could call up an audio recording of something that happened during the day
								by verbal keywords alone. I can't wait to see what innovative, unique, and crazy ideas they'll come up with this year.
								<br><br>
								The Center Island Toronto International Dragon Boat Race Festival (TIDBRF) is coming up in less than two weeks. To say that we, as a team, are jittery is an
								understatement. Jittery? Yeah. Unprepared? Hell, no! After getting a regatta under our collective belts, as well as twice-weekly practices on-the-water, we're
								confident we can really make a splash!

								Milton Dragon Boat Regatta
							</span>
							<br>
							<span style="font-size:12px;">
								May 29 2016
							</span> <br><br>
								On May 21st 2016, the University of Toronto Scarborough's very own Crimson Tide Dragon Boat Team went on to participate in the
								Milton Dragon Boat Regatta, Lively Dragon.
								<br><br>
								Man oh man was it fun. Everyone got up early in the morning - think 4AM for most people - arriving with only a few hours of sleep 
								(I know I had four hours myself, some people had less than two...) DESPITE ALL THAT, everyone was surprisingly energetic and excited
								- for most of us, it was our first race, ever!
								<br><br>
								We started off with a placement 500m race, in which we did fairly well. We placed third amongst a total of six teams, which was fairly
								amazing considering we were facing the leading University teams (Rotman's Liquid Assets, and UTSG's Iron Dragons). We went on to race
								another 2 x 200m, another 500m race, and ended our day with a 2km race. The 2km, although we were all exhausted, was probably the most
								amazing part of the day. We started off strong, overtaking one team on our first turn (race was organized so that team departures 
								were staggered). By the end, we ended up overtaking a total of FIVE different teams. 
								<br><br>
								Never satisfied, we immediately turned our sights to the Toronto International Dragon Boat Race Festival to be held in Center Island. Of course,
								first we went out and celebrated with some Indian food. An extraordinary way to cap off an extraordinary day.

								Finishing Up The Website
							</span>
							<br>
							<span style="font-size:12px;">
								May 26 2016
							</span> <br><br>
								Wow, after almost four months of working on and off on this website, I can say that I'm pretty satisfied with the results. This was my first personal web development 
								and web design project. Of course, I'm not an AMAZING designer, so maybe the color scheme is lame. Maybe I use too many horizontal rules (hr), but dang it, I think it looks
								pretty good!
								<br><br>
								I think I need to work on the formatting and presentation of the About pages a little more, because right now they're a little bit cluttered. School is on my tail though,
								even though I'm only taking three courses, it feels like each course has something due every day. I'll get around to it... sometime.
