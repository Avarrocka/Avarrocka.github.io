Takes a number n, and returns the nth sum of the series (1, -2, 3, -4...), we will call this the add/subtract series.


Precondition: n is a natural number


Postcondition: Returns the nth sum of the add/subtract series


1 add_subtract(n):

2 sum = 0

3 i = 0

4 while(i <= n):

5    if(i % 2 == 0)

6        sum = sum - i

7    else

8        sum = sum + 1

9    i = i + 1

10 return sum
