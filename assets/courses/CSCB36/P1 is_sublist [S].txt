Takes in two lists a, b and determines if a or b are sublists of each other. That is, every element in b, in the same order, is contained in a, or vice versa.

Precondition: a and b are nonempty lists
Postcondition: Returns if a or b are sublists of each other.

1 is_sublist(a, b):
2 if(len(a) > len(b)):
3     c = b
4     b = a
5     a = c

7 if(len(a) == 1):
8     return a[0] == b[0]
9 elif(a[0] == b[0])
10    return (a[1:], b[1:])
11 else:
12     return False
