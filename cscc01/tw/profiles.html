								<h3>Calvin L.</h3>
							</header>
							<p style="text-align:justify"><span class="image left round"><img src="images/calvin.png" alt="" /></span>Currently studying at UTSC (University of Toronto Scarborough), Calvin is a third year student pursuing a specialist in the Software Engineering stream. Calvin has been programming for over 5 years, and over this time has gained proficiency programming in various languages starting with Visual Basic, and gradually expanding into languages such as Java, Python, and C. On top of that, he also has some experience in working with databases using SQL along with elements of web design (HTML, CSS, PHP,  Javascript), so in any situation he is comfortable working in either the front or back end. Calvin is always open to learning new languages and computer science concepts and won't back down from any challenge he encounters along the way, and has his eyes set on developing useful web and mobile applications in the future.</p>

								<h3>Johnathan T.</h3>
							</header>
							<p style="text-align:justify"><span class="image left round"><img src="images/john.png" alt="" /></span>Johnathan is a third year student in the University of Toronto studying computer science and statistics. He is a helpful and responsible team player having worked with professionals in I.T. operations department in a bank. After gaining such experience, he is keen on learning more about mobile application development as he has discovered real world application of computer science. His passion towards programming, apart from the discovery of the later years, also came from the interest of video games. His interest in video games ushered him into the world of programming and learning more towards computer graphics and games. It is then when he learned to very basic knowledge in this field, through the help of video tutorials. This is when he established his goal in learning how various applications in the real world works behind applications that connecting and assisting people every day.</p>

							<p style="text-align:justify"><span class="image left round"><img src="images/raph.png" alt="" /></span>Raphael is currently a 3rd year student at the University of Toronto (Scarborough) where he is pursuing a double major in computer science and statistics.  His interest in programming started at the age of 12 when he discovered video tutorials on making computer programs using Visual Basic.  Since then, his interest only grew as he continued to learn new programming languages and techniques.  He is also interested in mobile app development, game development, and also has his eyes on the database side of things.  Prior to entering university, he was awarded for his performance in computer science during his senior year of high school.  For now, Raphael would like to develop and publish multi-platform applications when not occupied with studies.</p>
