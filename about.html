					Hi, welcome!
					<br><br>
					My name is Brian Chen and I am a first-year student at the University of Toronto, pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science.
					<br><br>
					I've been coding since I first took a computer science class in Grade 10, and I haven't looked back. I've done Web Development, Software Engineering,
					Android Development, and Game Development. Some of the projects and other things that I've worked on are avaliable on my GitHub, and on the Projects page
					of this website.
					<br>
					<br>
					I love playing and creating games. I'm currently working on a version of Bomberman to familiarize myself with Unity, as well as looking into how to start with
					Unreal Engine.
					<br><br>
					I occasionally also do contest programming, on websites such as TopCoder, USACO, and OpenKattis, as well as discuss contest problems with my friends.

						(2015) Created a crowd-sourced lost and found Android app to reunite people with their belongings. When an user loses an item, they send out an alert. Anyone within a close enough geographical area (located by GPS)
						will get a notification about the lost item. Anyone who finds the item can contact the original poster to return the item to them.
						Incorporated the Twilio and Twitter APIs and cooperated with a team member to build the backend web portion of the project using PHP and MySQL

						Created an android application - OneMark - for congregating and summarizing grades pulled from internet
						sources (e.g. Blackboard, Desire to Learn). Instead of Students checking many websites to find out marks, OneMark offers students a program that once given credentials and URLs to websites,
						will collect and consolidate all marks into one application. This app offers ease-of-use, and offers diagnostic breakdowns of marks over time, marks needed to achieve goal grade, and other quality of life features.
