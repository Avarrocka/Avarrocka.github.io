					<span style="font-style:italic" >Fuudi is a Android application that serves as a fantasy football manager. Developed for the CFL during SportsHack2016.</span>
					<br><span style="font-weight:bold">Not official application nor otherwise affiliated with the CFL.</span>
					<br>
					<br>
					Fuudi is a fantasy football buddy, or a information consolidation application that helps CFL fantasy football players get more knowledge of their lineups
					and players. By listing information about the players such as height, position, status updates, injury reports, and trade rumors, owners of players in fantasy
					leagues can gain a competitive edge against their competition.
					<br>
					<br>
					Fuudi offers owners a list of Players of Interest, for quick access to key players. It also offers advanced information regarding players, their stats, and positions.
					Statistical analysis performed on metrics found on BigDataUniversity are also analyzed and shown to the user. Live twitter updates can keep the user informed about how the player
					is doing, and whatever good or bad play that they may have just made. Trade rumors and injury reports help owners to set their lineups or make quick decisions about 
					players on the go.
					<br>
					<br>
					In helping create Fuudi, I learned about Android Development using Android Studio, Data Science, and familiarized myself with the Twitter API.
					<br>
					<br>
					Fuudi was created
					in collaboration with three other developers, <a href="https://github.com/wgma00"> William </a>, <a href="https://github.com/justinli1">Justin</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/aditpatel14">Adit</a>. We employed Agile Development methods and used Github as a collaborative platform.

					<span style="font-style:italic" >PokéTbase allows competitive pokemon players to cross reference an opponents team with known teams compositions in online forums. Requires PyQt4 to run.</span>
					<br><span style="font-weight:bold">Not an official application nor otherwise affiliated with Pokémon.</span>
					<br>
					<br>
					In the world of competitive Pokémon, battling teams has become extremely tactical - different Pokémon have movesets that synergize well with each other, leading up to
					potentially deadly combinations. With PokéTBase, you can cross-reference your own team, or your enemy's team to see what the internet has to say about their team composition.
					By knowing one's opponent's win conditions and playstyles, trainers will be more prepared to face different and unorthodox teams.
					<br>
					<br>
					PokéTBase takes a teamset, which is a group of Pokémon that comprise a team. It webcrawls popular online Pokémon forums for similar teams, and displays the discussion
					between users about the strengths and weaknesses of the team, as well as the movesets (abilities) and tactics employed by the team. For example, one team may seek to 
					buff their stats to ridiculous amounts and then use one strong Pokémon to sweep the team, while others may use control-based tactics such as paralysis or sleep. By giving
					the user access to players who may have previously played against/with these teamsets, the user gains a competitive edge to possibly beating their competition.
					<br>
					<br>
					In helping create PokéTBase, I learned about Python Applications, GUI, and working with PyQT. 
					<br>
					<br>
					PokéTBase was created in collaboration with another developer, <a href="https://github.com/wgma00"> William Granados. </a>

					<span style="font-style:italic" >IvyGlobal Classroom is a virtual learning and course management environment.</span>
					<br><span style="font-weight:bold">Not an official application nor otherwise affiliated with the TDSB.</span>
					<br>
					<br>
					IvyGlobal Classroom is a tool that helps teachers manage their virtual classroom. Students can register for a class and see the
					syllabus for the class, detailed lesson plans regarding a class, as well as all classes for which they are registered. Teachers are
					able to monitor student performance, create tests, new classes, and assign homework/create lesson plans for students. This highly
					streamlined and efficient system creates an easy to use and intuitive virtual learning environment.
					<br>
					<br>
					IvyGlobal classroom offers advanced analytics for each class, including test scores, individual student performances, and average performances.
					Teachers can use these helpful analytics to cater and adjust the direction of their course as they see fit. They are also able to post notes and
					reminders to students, for homework help or important reminders.
					<br>
					<br>
					In helping create IvyGlobal Classroom, I learned to work with advanced CSS, AJAX, Angular JS, ASP.net, and MongoDB.
